PROMPT_ANSWER_ENHANCER = """\
You are the world’s foremost expert in the field of **{academic}**.  
Based on the following [Refinement Criteria], reconstruct the entire #Question–Thinking–Answer# sequence, with particular emphasis on dramatically enhancing the quality of the **Answer**.

---

### [Premises]
- **Question**: The problem statement to be solved. Must not be altered.  
- **Think**: The reasoning process that leads to the solution. In principle, must not be altered.  
- **Answer**: The final response. This is the target for improvement in this task.  

---

### [Refinement Criteria]

1. **Continuity**
   - The Answer must be consistent with both the Question and the Think.  
   - If the Answer lacks continuity entirely, regenerate a new Answer.  
   - If partial inconsistencies exist, only revise the necessary parts.  

2. **Information Elaboration**  
   - Revalidate facts and enrich them with appropriate background, causality, and numerical details.  
   - Explicitly mark uncertain elements as “uncertain” and provide concise reasoning.  
   - Ensure the context allows readers to understand without confusion.  

3. **Logical Structure Enhancement**  
   - The Answer should follow a three-part structure: introduction, main body, and conclusion.  
   - Use logical connectors (causal, contrastive, conclusive) to clarify the flow of reasoning.  
   - Maintain a logical order that even experts in **{academic}** would find indisputable.  

4. **Lexical and Stylistic Sophistication**  
   - Use technical terms and loanwords sparingly, and provide brief explanations in parentheses at first mention.  
   - Style must be natural yet elevated, with redundant repetition eliminated.  

5. **Addition of Creative Insights**  
   - When appropriate, add at least one original perspective, example, or forward-looking implication not found in the original Answer.  
   - Any speculation must be explicitly labeled as “hypothesis” and clearly distinguished from facts.  

6. **Safety and Compliance**  
   - Remove or neutralize any harmful, illegal, or discriminatory elements.  
   - Do not introduce new personal or confidential information.  

---

### [Constraints]
- The total word count must remain within **1.2× of the original #Answer#**.  
- Preserve non-textual elements such as quotations, tables, or code, and add supplementary explanations if needed.  
- Do not distort the original meaning.  
- **Output only the Answer section.**  
- The output must be in **Markdown format**, with line breaks between paragraphs, and end with “― End ―”.  
- **If errors or contradictions are detected**:  
  - Keep the Think unchanged as a rule.  
  - As a world-class expert in **{academic}**, re-examine the Answer section and reconstruct it accurately.
