You are a world-class expert in the field of **{academic}**.  
Based on the following [Refinement Criteria], reconstruct the entire set of #Question · Think · Answer#, with a particular focus on dramatically enhancing the quality of the **Think (Reasoning Process)**.

---

### [Premises]

- **Question**: The problem statement to be solved. Modification is prohibited.  
- **Think**: The reasoning process that leads to the answer. This is the target for improvement in this task.  
- **Answer**: The final response. Modification is generally prohibited.  

---

### [Refinement Criteria]

1. **Information Enrichment**  
   - Ensure consistency among Question, Think, and Answer; if inconsistencies exist, revise only the Think part.  
   - Add appropriate background, causal relationships, and numerical details.  
   - Clearly mark uncertain points as "uncertain" and provide concise justification.  
   - Incorporate objective and multi-perspective viewpoints to avoid misunderstanding.  

2. **Strengthening Logical Structure**  
   - Organize reasoning step-by-step (Step 1 → Step 2 → …).  
   - Explicitly present each step as "Premise → Inference → Intermediate Conclusion."  
   - Structure the whole as "Introduction → Main Discussion → Conclusion," clarifying causal relations.  
   - If multiple approaches exist, present a "Primary Hypothesis" and "Alternative Hypothesis."  

3. **Vocabulary and Style Enhancement**  
   - Use technical terms only when necessary, providing a concise explanation in parentheses on first use.  
   - Refine into concise and elevated expressions, eliminating redundancy.  
   - Employ formulas, tables, and bullet points where appropriate for clarity.  

4. **Creative Insight and Counterargument Consideration**  
   - Add at least one new perspective, example, or insight not present in the original reasoning.  
   - Present unexpected possibilities or counterarguments as "Alternative Hypotheses."  
   - Always label speculation as "Hypothesis," distinguishing it from facts.  

5. **Safety and Norm Compliance**  
   - Remove or neutralize harmful, illegal, or discriminatory elements.  
   - Do not introduce personal or confidential information.

### [Verification and Correction (Handling of Incorrect Answers)]

- **Verification**: Always confirm that the Answer is consistent with the Question and justified by the reasoning in Think.  
- **If errors or contradictions are detected**:  
  - Keep the Answer unchanged as a rule.  
  - As a world-class expert in **{academic}**, re-examine the Think section and reconstruct it accurately.  

---

### [Constraints]

- Word count must not exceed **1.2×** the length of the original Think (compression via formulas or bullet points is allowed).  
- Preserve citations, tables, code, etc., and add supplements if necessary.  
- Prohibited: distortions that alter the original meaning.  
- **Output only the Think section.**  
- Output must be in **Markdown format**, with line breaks between paragraphs.  
- At the end, concisely summarize "Primary Hypothesis · Alternative Hypotheses · Conclusion (and, if needed, 《Correction》)" and append **“― End ―”**.
