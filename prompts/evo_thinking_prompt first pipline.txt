You are the world’s leading expert in the field of **#Given Question Thinking Answer set#**.  
Following the [Thinking Tag Refinement Criteria] below, reconstruct **only the content within the <thinking></thinking> tags** of the #Given Question Thinking Answer set#, and elevate its intellectual rigor and expressive clarity to the highest level.  
The contents of <input></input> and <output></output> must remain strictly unchanged.

---

### [Premises]

- `<input></input>`: The “question text” to be solved. Do not modify.  
- `<thinking></thinking>`: The “reasoning process” for solving the question. This is the sole target for reconstruction.  
- `<output></output>`: The “answer” derived from the reasoning process. Do not modify.

### [Thinking Tag Refinement Criteria]

1. **Information Enhancement**  
   - Ensure full consistency among input, thinking, and output.  
   - Re-examine facts and enrich the reasoning with relevant context, causal links, and quantitative details.  
   - Mark uncertain elements explicitly as “uncertain” and provide concise justification.  
   - Incorporate multiple perspectives to sustain an objective and unambiguous context.  

2. **Logical Structure Reinforcement**  
   - Present reasoning step by step (Step 1 → Step 2 → …).  
   - Divide each stage into “Premise → Reasoning → Intermediate Conclusion.”  
   - Organize the whole into a clear “Introduction → Main Analysis → Conclusion” structure, clarifying causality, contrasts, and consequences.  
   - Where multiple approaches exist, present both the “primary hypothesis” and “alternative hypotheses.”  

3. **Vocabulary and Stylistic Refinement**  
   - Use technical terms only when necessary, providing a brief parenthetical explanation at first mention.  
   - Refine the prose into natural, precise, and elevated academic language, eliminating redundancy.  
   - Employ mathematical expressions, tables, or bullet points where appropriate for clarity and conciseness.  

4. **Creative Insight and Counterargument Analysis**  
   - Add at least one original perspective, illustrative example, or forward-looking implication absent from the original reasoning.  
   - Present unexpected possibilities or counterarguments explicitly as “alternative hypotheses.”  
   - Clearly label speculative reasoning as “hypothesis,” maintaining strict separation from established fact.  

5. **Safety and Norm Compliance**  
   - Remove or neutralize harmful, unlawful, or discriminatory content.  
   - Do not introduce personal or confidential information.

### [Constraints]

- The length must not exceed **1.5× the original <thinking> section**, though compression via formulas or bullet points is permitted.  
- Retain quotations, tables, code, and other non-text elements, adding clarifications where appropriate.  
- Do not introduce alterations that distort the original meaning.  
- Output must consist of **only the <thinking> section**.  
- Output must be formatted in **Markdown**, with clear paragraph breaks.  
- At the end, concisely summarize “Primary Hypothesis, Alternative Hypotheses, and Conclusion,” and close with **“― End ―”**.
